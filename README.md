### Hello there
- I'm a physics student in Milan and I'm interested in **numerical methods**, **theoretical and computational physics**, **mathematics** and **philosophy of science**.
- My main project is [Theoretica](https://github.com/chaotic-society/theoretica), a mathematical library in C++ which implements many concepts and methods of numerical analysis, real and complex analysis and linear algebra.
- I have experience programming with OpenGL and I programmed in C, C++, Java, Python and Scheme in the past. Now I mostly use C and C++ but I'm looking forward to learn more about Common Lisp.
