### Hello,
I'm a physicist and software engineer interested in theoretical and computational physics, numerical methods, mathematics and philosophy of science.
Check out [my blog](https://mattiaisgro.github.io) where I write about these topics.

## Projects
- [Theoretica](https://github.com/chaotic-society/theoretica), a numerical and automatic mathematical library in C++ for scientific and graphical applications.
- [Chebyshev](https://github.com/chaotic-society/chebyshev), a unit testing framework specialized in testing scientific software.
- [FCC-ZeeTauTau](https://github.com/mattiaisgro/fcc-zeetautau), selection and reconstruction of $Z \rightarrow \tau \tau$ events at FCC-ee, developed during my stay at CERN.
